A percentile is a measure that tells us what percentage of values in a dataset are below a certain value. For example, the 75th percentile represents the value below which 75% of the data falls. Similarly, the 25th percentile represents the value below which 25% of the data falls. When we talk about the top 25%, we are referring to the values that fall above the 75th percentile, which represent the top quarter of the data. On the other hand, when we talk about the bottom 25%, we are referring to the values that fall below the 25th percentile, which represent the bottom quarter of the data. By focusing on these groups, we can identify patterns and trends that may be useful for making decisions and taking action.*\n",
